Once the application is installed, it will be able to recognise the hardware when you plug it in; click yes to auto launching the application, or navigate to the application yourself. 

Once launched, the application will assert your hardware is detected, click the name of the identified hardware to launch the demo selector.

The available demo apps are presented, pick one!

Pressure distribution map: this will give you an  attractive feedback response to your input in terms of the sides and rear sensors.

Thumb scroller: this will present a demo article that can be scrolled normally using your thumb on the touchscreen, or better, place the thumb on the top right side strip as you would usually grip your device, and roll your thumb in a upwards/downwards motion to scroll the article. The applied force will affect teh speed of the scroll. 

Photo launcher: hold the phone in a landscape orientation, and squeeze the side sensors to take a picture.


Each demo app can be exited by pressing the back button on your phone, which will take you back to the demo selector app. Pressing back again will confirm you want to exit the application (and kill its process). 

Plugging the device out in any of these demo apps will quit the application entirely.
